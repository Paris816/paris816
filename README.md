# Paris' Website

Hi I'm Paris, 20 years old.


How headers work: 6 font sizes, h1 through h6. h1 being the largest. Use hashtag symbol.
## This text is smaller than
#This text
How lists work: Use numbers for numbers (actual number doesnt matter) use asterisk for bullet and an indented number for roman numerals.
1. i numbered this one
2. i numbered this two
2. i numbered this two as well.
How tables work: Use pipes to indicate column breaks. Use a row of dashes to separate table input from first row header.
My | First | Table
--- | --- | ---
Happy | To Be | Coding(:

How links work: 2 ways to format. Both start wtih the text you want to hyperlink in single brackets. One is followed by an actual link,
the other is followed by a referenced link.
